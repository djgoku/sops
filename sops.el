;;; Commentary:

;; Transparent decryption on find-file and encryption on save-buffer for
;; SOPS-encrypted files.  See README and the design spec at
;; docs/superpowers/specs/ for architecture and rationale.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(cl-defstruct (sops-state (:constructor sops-state-create)
                          (:conc-name sops-state-))
  "Buffer-local state for sops-mode."
  status        ; 'decrypted | 'creating
  last-error)   ; nil or string with most recent sops stderr

(provide 'sops)
;;; sops.el ends here
